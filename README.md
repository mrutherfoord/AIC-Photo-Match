# AIC-Photo-Match
Web app project using paintings from the Art Institute of Chicago

# Goals
The first goal of this project is to build a web application that allows users to upload a photo and returns a painting from the art institute that most closely matches the dominant color of the uploaded image. Ultimately, the user will be able to choose a color palette (analagous, complimentary, or tertiary), and have the application return paintings that most closely match the palette.
